The algorithm Google uses to rank your site in its search engine results
pages is highly complex and the team who work on it are highly
secretive. There are very few who know exactly how it works. The
algorithm is often updated and refined which means keeping your site at
the top of search results is an ongoing task. 

In a recent keynote speech
at [PubCon][], a Google engineer Matt Cutts, revealed that there are
roughly 200 different variables which are analysed by the algorithm when
it’s deciding where to rank your site. Over at [Search Engine
Journal][], Ann Smarty and her readers are attempting to put together a
definitive list of these variables. Of course nobody knows how accurate
this list is, however with the input of hundreds of SEO specialists with
years of experience it’s very likely that many of the these factors are
correct.
