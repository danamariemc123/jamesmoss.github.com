Historically Google have always been very secretive about the algorithms
which power their search technology. Over the past few months however,
they have publishing [small tidbits of information][] on how Google
Search works in an effort to appear more transparent. Today the man in
charge of Core Ranking at Google, Amit Singhal, has publicly spoken
about how search works. In particular he talks about the three core
philosopies:

1.  Best locally relevant results served globally.
2.  Keep it simple.
3.  No manual intervention.

The article doesnâ€™t go into much detail and really only covers some of
the basic details behind the ranking algorithm but nevertheless it makes
for an interesting read. Head over to the [Google Blog][] now to check
out [his post][].
