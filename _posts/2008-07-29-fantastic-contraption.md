Iâ€™m not normally a big fan of Flash games, they tend to either be poorly
implemented or lacking scope. This week however, I discovered the
brilliant physics based Flash game [Fantastic Contraption][].

The premise is simple; using a series of different rods and wheels you must
build a machine to move a ball into a target zone. You are free to build
your machine however you like and because of this the game is extremely
open ended.

By creating a standard account,
Fantastic Contraption lets you save your designs and share them with
friends as well as browse through other people attempts. After upgrading
to a full account (a one-time fee of $10), you are able to create your
own levels and share them with others.

[Colin Northway and his team][] have turned a great idea into a well
executed puzzler which I highly reccommend.
