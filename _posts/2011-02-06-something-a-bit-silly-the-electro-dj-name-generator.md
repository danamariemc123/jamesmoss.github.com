I’ve always found name generators pretty funny, the ones where you enter
your real name and it gives you a comedy name based on a certain subject
like [Brazilian footballers][] or [Jedi knights][]. 

A year or so ago,
myself and a friend were trying to come up with names for our DJ
partnership and I put together this [electro DJ name generator][] as a
bit of fun using parts of the names of popular acts at the time. It
combines them together with pretty hilarious results. Here’s a few of my
favourite:

-   Fantasy French
-   Horrorwax
-   Mr DJ
-   Diabolical Crunk
